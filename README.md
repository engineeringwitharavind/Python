The Python learning ecosystem has grown exponentially in the past few years, and still gaining momentum. These exercises will be useful to know How Python works!

All of these exercises is useful to get to know How **Python** works with **Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Variables, Identifiers,
Arguments, Parameters, Functions, Scope of Variables**

#### Requirements

These Exercises Solutions are done with **Python-3.7.1**.So I recommend you to use Python version 3 and above.

### Downloading the Exercises

To get started, you can start by either downloading a zip file of these assignments by clicking on the Clone or download button. If you have `git` installed on your system, you can clone this repository using :

```
git clone https://github.com/i-m-aravind/Python-Practice-Exercises.git
```

Each folder contains two files:

- A PNG file `.png` contains Questions for all the Exercises Seperately.

- A python file `.py` contains solutions done by me. You can correct me if i am wrong and modify it as needed.

### Python Installation

I recommend using anaconda for installing python. Go to [Anaconda's download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Make sure to download Python 3.7 version and above. If you are on a windows machine:

- Open the executable file after downloading is complete and follow instructions.

- Once installation is complete, open Anaconda prompt from the start menu. This will open a terminal with python enabled.

If you are on a **Linux** machine:

- Open a terminal `Ctrl + Alt + T` and navigate to the directory where Anaconda was downloaded.

- Change the permission to the downloaded file so that it can be executed. So if the downloaded file name is `Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`, then use the following command:

 ```
 chmod a+x Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

- Now, run the installation script using `./Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`, and follow installation instructions in the terminal.

#### Or

You can Install **Python version: 3.7.1** seperately by downloading [Here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/)

After Installing Python Open your Command Prompt `windows + r` and Type `python` and press `Enter`

You will see something like this:

```
> Python 3.7.1 (default, Dec 10 2018, 22:54:23) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32
> Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>>
```

Then Download and Install **Pycharm** Community edition which is [Here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) and Start working on your exercises. 

If you are on a **Linux** machine:

- Open the Terminal `Ctrl+Alt+T` Check for the Updates by entering `sudo apt-get update` and 
install python 3.7 

```
sudo apt-get install python3.7
```

- After Installation,verify the version by typing 

```
python3 --version
```

- Then,to install **PyCharm** first install Snap Package Management which is better way to install packages on Ubuntu
by entering 

```
sudo apt install snapd snapd-xdg-open
```

and now for **PyCharm** enter 

```
sudo snap install pycharm-community --classic
```

and start working on your exercises.
