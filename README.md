The Python learning ecosystem has grown exponentially in the past few years, and still gaining momentum. I think that many students who want to get started with their Python learning journey like. It is for those reasons I have decided to re-write all the programming assignments in Python, so students like me can get acquainted with its ecosystem from the start of their learning journey.

All are very Basic exercises to get to know How **Python** works with **Strings,Lists,Tuples,Dictionary,Variables,Identifiers,
Arguments,Parameters,Functions,Scope of Variables**

## Requirements
These Exercises Solutions are done with **Python-3.7.1**.So I recommend you to use Python version 3.7 and above.

## Downloading the Exercises
To get started, you can start by either downloading a zip file of these assignments by clicking on the Clone or download button. If you have git installed on your system, you can clone this repository using :

> clone https://github.com/i-m-aravind/Python-Practice-Exercises.git

Each folder contains two files:
- A PNG file `.png` contains Questions for all the Exercises Seperately.
- A python file `.py` contains solutions done by me. You can correct me if i am wrong and modify it as needed.

## Python Installation

I highly recommend using anaconda for installing python. [Click here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to go to Anaconda's download page. Make sure to download Python 3.7 version and above. If you are on a windows machine:

- Open the executable file after downloading is complete and follow instructions.
- Once installation is complete, open Anaconda prompt from the start menu. This will open a terminal with python enabled.

If you are on a **Linux** machine:

- Open a terminal `Ctrl + Alt + T` and navigate to the directory where Anaconda was downloaded.

- Change the permission to the downloaded file so that it can be executed. So if the downloaded file name is `Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`, then use the following command:

 > chmod a+x Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

- Now, run the installation script using `./Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`, and follow installation instructions in the terminal.

###### Or
You can Install **Python -version: 3.7.1** seperately by downloading [Here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/
)

After Installing Python Open your Command Prompt `windows + r` and Type `python` and press `Enter`

You will see something like this:
> Python 3.7.1 (default, Dec 10 2018, 22:54:23) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32
> Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>>

Then Download and Install **Pycharm** Community edition which is [Here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
and Start working on your exercises. 

If you are on a **Linux** machine:

- Open the Terminal `Ctrl+Alt+T` Check for the Updates by entering `sudo apt-get update` and 
install python 3.7 `sudo apt-get install python3.7`
- After Installation,verify the version by typing `python3.7 --version`.
-Then,to install **PyCharm** first install Snap Package Management which is better way to install packages on Ubuntu
by entering 
`sudo apt install snapd snapd-xdg-open` 
and now for **PyCharm** enter 
`sudo snap install pycharm-community --classic` and start working on your exercises.

## Python Tutorials
If you are new to programming or Python, no worries! There are plenty of tutorials and documentation to get you started. Here are a few links which might be of help:
- [Python Programming:](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-to-python-programming/) A turorial with videos about the basics of python.
- [Python in Action:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-examples/) If you are comformtable with basics,then dive into this website which is best according to me.
